 *
 * The services — and the environment and log inside them — are built here
 * rather than read from disk, so a test states the settings it depends on and
 * never writes into storage/. That is only possible because the Kernel is
 * handed them instead of finding them.
 *
 * No middleware is composed in by default, so writes are not CSRF-challenged
 * and most tests stay a single call. Override middleware() to test against
 * what the application actually boots with.
