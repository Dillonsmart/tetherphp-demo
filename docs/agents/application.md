# Working in the skeleton application

> Read this before adding or changing an Action, Domain, Responder, route, view or command, or when deciding whether a change belongs here or in the framework package.

This repository is a TetherPHP application made with `composer create-project dillonsmart/tetherphp`. The framework
is **not** here — it is the `dillonsmart/tetherphp-core` Composer package, installed into
`vendor/dillonsmart/tetherphp-core`. This guide is the one the skeleton ships, kept because everything in it still
holds; the parts specific to this application — the database, the `Invalid` result, the form partial — are in
`AGENTS.md` and `README.md`.

## Design constraints

TetherPHP is built on six core principles, summarised in `AGENTS.md` and carried in full by
`docs/agents/principles.md` in the `tetherphp-core` repository. The ones that shape this repository most:
**Explicit Over Magic** — `Request → Route → Action → Domain → Responder → Response` must stay traceable by reading —
and **One Obvious Way**, which is why the skeleton ships one convention rather than demonstrating several.

## Layout

```
app/
├── Actions/      # Actions\      — receive the Request, invoke a Domain, hand off to a Responder
├── Commands/     # Commands\     — console commands (created by make:command)
├── Domains/      # Domains\      — business logic, no HTTP knowledge
├── Responders/   # Responders\   — turn a result into a response (view or JSON)
├── Services.php  # App\Services  — what the application is made of; built in public/index.php
└── Views/        # Views\        — templates, partials, error pages
public/           # web root: index.php, compiled css/js
tests/            # Tests\ — Unit/ and Feature/
resources/css/    # Tailwind source
routes/web.php    # route definitions
routes/middleware.php  # what every request passes through
storage/          # logs and application storage
tether            # console entry point — a shim over vendor/bin/tether
```

**Every feature is a directory.** A feature is named, and what it does within that feature is named separately:

```
app/Actions/Home/Index.php            Actions\Home\Index
app/Domains/Home/Index.php            Domains\Home\Index
app/Domains/Home/Results/Page.php     Domains\Home\Results\Page
app/Responders/Home/Index.php         Responders\Home\Index
app/Views/pages/home/index.php
```

`tether make:feature Blog` writes one operation into that shape and `tether make:resource Post` writes seven — the
same layout either way, so **a feature grows by addition**: `tether make:action Blog Show` puts a second operation
beside the first and moves nothing. A Result lives with the Domain that returns it, so one feature owns one
directory under `Domains/`.

Actions, Domains and Responders are named for the operation. **A Result is named for its shape**, and shared by
every operation of the feature that answers the same way: `Collection` for many records, `Record` for one, `Written`
for a write that answers with a redirect, `Page` for a page with neither behind it.

## Request lifecycle

`public/index.php` loads the autoloader, builds the `Services` the application runs with, builds a `Router` and
applies `routes/web.php` to it, loads the middleware list from `routes/middleware.php`, and calls `send()` on the
`Response` that `Kernel::run()` returns. So **an Action must return a `Response`** — `send()` is the only place
anything is written to the client.

What the application is made of is **handed to the Kernel, not found by it**:

```php
$services = new Services(
    env: Env::fromFile(__DIR__ . '/../.env'),
    log: new Log(__DIR__ . '/../storage/logs'),
);

$middleware = (require __DIR__ . '/../routes/middleware.php')($services->env, $services->log);

new Kernel($router, $services, $middleware)->run()->send();
```

Which `.env` is read, where logs are written, what else the application has and what wraps a request are all
answered by reading this file. Change any of those lines — a different environment file per deployment, a log
directory outside the project, a second database — and nothing in the framework needs to know.

### How a Domain gets a dependency

`App\Services` is the application's own class — `final readonly`, one public property per thing the application
has. `Env` and `Log` are the two that `ServicesInterface` requires, because the Kernel runs on them: it reads
`APP_DEBUG`, logs what goes wrong, and installs both for the `env()` and `logger()` helpers. Everything else on the
class is yours. The Kernel constructs every Action with `($request, $services)`, and the Action hands its Domain the
pieces the Domain asks for:

```php
// app/Actions/Home/Index.php
public function __construct(protected Request $request, Services $services)
{
    $this->domain = new IndexDomain($services->env);
    $this->responder = new IndexResponder($request);
}

// app/Domains/Home/Index.php
public function __construct(private Env $env)
{
}
```

Three rules:

- **A Domain takes what it needs, never `Services`.** Its constructor is then the complete list of what it depends
  on, and `tests/Unit/HomeDomainTest.php` builds one with `new Env([...])` and no global. A Domain that took the
  whole object would depend on everything and say nothing. The same goes for `env()` and `logger()`: they exist for
  views, which nothing constructs; a Domain is handed its `Env`.
- **Add a dependency in two places.** A property on `Services` — `public PDO $db` — and its construction in
  `public/index.php` — `db: new PDO($env->get('DB_DSN') ?? '')`. Nothing else changes, and nothing is looked up by
  name. A class of your own that `Services` holds lives under `app/Services/` in the `App\Services` namespace.
- **Build it, don't make it lazy.** Everything in `Services` is constructed on every request, in the order written.
  Something expensive that most requests never touch should connect on first use — the way `Session` does —
  rather than the wiring growing closures.

`php tether inspect App\Services` lists what it provides, `inspect` on an Action shows it takes one, and
`php tether context` carries the class and its properties under `services`. None of them construct it.

What this does not cover: `routes/middleware.php` still takes `(Env, Log)`, because the console builds that list to
report it and cannot build the application's services. A middleware that needs a connection has no explicit route
to one yet.

`Kernel` then installs error and exception handlers, and routes.

### Middleware

`routes/middleware.php` lists what every request passes through, outermost first, in the order written:

```php
return function (Env $env, Log $log): array {
    return [
        new OverridesMethod(),
        new VerifyCsrfToken(new Session(), $log),
    ];
};
```

It sits beside `routes/web.php` because the two answer the same kind of question: `web.php` says where a request
goes, `middleware.php` says what it goes through on the way. `public/index.php` loads both.

A middleware is one method — `__invoke(Request $request, \Closure $next): Response`. Call `$next($request)` to
continue and you get the Response from the rest of the pipeline, to return, replace or add a header to. Return your
own Response without calling `$next` and nothing after it runs, which is how a guard refuses a request. Throwing an
`HttpException` works too, and is the same way an Action ends a request early.

Middleware wraps routing, not just the Action, so it runs for a request that goes on to 404 — and sees that 404 on
the way back out.

**The framework starts no session, checks no CSRF token and honours no `_method` field of its own accord.** The
skeleton composes `OverridesMethod` and `VerifyCsrfToken` in because most applications serve forms; an application
that does not — a token-authenticated API — deletes both lines and boots with no session at all. CSRF used to be
validated inside `Request`, so it could not be turned off.

`OverridesMethod` goes first so that `VerifyCsrfToken` logs the verb the form asked for rather than the POST it
arrived as. A browser form can only send GET or POST, so without it the router's `put()`, `patch()` and `delete()`
routes are unreachable from a page.

**Building a middleware must have no side effects.** `php tether routes`, `explain` and `context` build this list to
report what runs around a request, so a constructor that opens a connection or starts a session does it from a
terminal too. Do the work in `__invoke()`. `Session` starts on first use rather than on construction for this
reason, so holding one costs nothing.

`php tether explain /some/uri` shows the middleware a request passes through before the route it resolves to.

## ADR conventions

- An **Action** implements `ActionInterface`, takes the `Request` and the `Services` in its constructor, and returns
  a `Response`. It coordinates; it should not contain business logic or build markup. Dynamic route parameters are
  on the request as `$this->request->params['slug']` — never re-parse the URI.
- A **Domain** holds the logic and knows nothing about HTTP. What it needs — an `Env`, a `PDO` — arrives through its
  constructor from the Action. `handle()` returns a **`DomainResult`** — never an array. See below.
- A **Responder** renders — `view()` or `json()`, both returning a `Response`. Pass a status as `view($name, $data, 404)` rather than calling `http_response_code()`.

### Domains return a result, not an array

`Domain::handle()` used to return `array<string, mixed>`, and the Responder passed that array straight to the view,
where `extract()` turned its keys into template variables. So the array's keys *were* the view's variable names:
renaming `$tagline` in a template meant editing `Domains\Home`. That is the coupling the Responder exists to absorb,
and while it lasted the Responder did nothing but forward its argument.

A Domain now returns a `final readonly` value object under `Domains\<Feature>\Results\`, implementing
`TetherPHP\framework\Interfaces\DomainResult` (an empty marker — it exists so `handle()` and `Action::respond()`
have a type). The Responder translates it:

```php
// app/Domains/Home/Results/Page.php — named for the domain
final readonly class Page implements DomainResult
{
    public function __construct(public string $name, public string $description) {}
}

// app/Responders/Home/Index.php — the one place view variables are named
public function __invoke(Page $result): Response
{
    return $this->view('pages.home.index', [
        'appName' => $result->name,
        'tagline' => $result->description,
    ]);
}
```

Two rules follow, and both are the point of the change:

- **Only a Responder may name a view variable.** If a Domain knows a template calls something `$tagline`, the
  separation is gone again.
- **One result type per outcome.** A feature that can miss returns a different class when it misses, and the
  Responder picks the view and the status from the type it was handed. An array with a `found` flag in it is the
  shape this change exists to remove.

Generate the trio rather than hand-rolling it:

```bash
php tether make:feature <name>                  # one operation: Action, Domain, Result, Responder and view
php tether make:resource <name> [--uri=/posts]  # seven operations, the Results they share, and the views
php tether make:action <feature> <operation>
php tether make:domain <feature> <operation>    # writes the Result too — the Domain's return type names it
php tether make:responder <feature> <operation> # writes the view too — the Responder renders it
php tether make:command <name>
```

`<operation>` defaults to `Index`, so `make:action Blog` and `make:action Blog Index` are the same call.

Generating a piece at a time is the same writer as generating the whole feature, so the two cannot drift apart.
`make:action` on its own says which of the Domain and Responder it names do not exist yet, because an Action that
references a missing class fatals on the first request rather than at generation time.

### Asking the application about itself

```bash
php tether routes                   # the resolved table, with anything that would 500 marked
php tether explain /blog/hello      # the path that URI takes through the pipeline
php tether inspect Home             # what a class is in ADR terms, and what it takes
php tether context                  # the whole application as JSON, for agents and tooling
php tether serve                    # PHP's built-in server, pointed at public/
php tether test                     # forwards to the application's own PHPUnit
```

`explain` resolves the URI the way a request would — compared case-insensitively, query string dropped — and names
the parameters a dynamic route would capture, so it answers "why does this 404?" without reading the matcher.

`routes` and `context` both mark a route whose Action is missing or does not implement `ActionInterface`. That is
otherwise a 500 nobody sees until someone requests the page.

Where these link an Action to a Domain and Responder, they say **by convention** — an Action constructs its own in
its constructor and may use anything. They report what is on disk under the conventional name.

`php tether help <command>` prints what one command takes.

Generated commands land in `app/Commands/` under the `Commands\` namespace. That PSR-4 mapping must stay in
`composer.json` — without it `Console::registerCommands()` cannot autoload them
and they disappear from `php tether help` with no error at all.

### The `tether` file

`tether` in the project root holds no console code. `tetherphp-core` declares `bin/tether` in its `composer.json`, so
Composer writes a proxy to `vendor/bin/tether` on install, and the root file forwards to that proxy:

```php
$binary = __DIR__ . '/vendor/bin/tether';
// ...
return require $binary;
```

It exists so `php tether help` still works from the project root, and so a generated application does not carry its
own copy of the console bootstrap that would drift from the framework's. `php vendor/bin/tether help` is the same
program.

Two consequences:

- Changing how the console boots — argument parsing, the autoloader lookup, the exit code — is a change to
  `bin/tether` in `tetherphp-core`, not to this file.
- The shim resolves only against a core release that declares the `bin`. Against an older one `vendor/bin/tether` is
  never written and the shim exits 1 telling you to run `composer install`, so bump the constraint in `composer.json`
  when adopting it.

## Routing

`routes/web.php` returns a closure taking the `Router`:

```php
return function (Router $router) {
    $router->get('/', Home::class);
    $router->get('/docs/{page}', Docs::class);
    $router->view('/terms', 'pages.terms');   // renders a view with no Action
    $router->group('admin', function (Router $router) {
        $router->get('/users', Users::class);
    });
};
```

Things worth knowing before debugging a route:

- Routes are **case-insensitive, but parameters are not normalised**. The Router compares segments with
  `strcasecmp` and captures `{param}` segments verbatim, so `/posts/My-Slug` matches `/posts/{slug}` and
  `params['slug']` is `My-Slug`. `Request::$uri` is never rewritten — it used to be lowercased by a property hook,
  which made routing a slug or a UUID impossible.
- A static route wins over a dynamic route of the same shape.
- A dynamic route only matches a URI with the **same number of `/`-separated segments**.
- `group()` requires a non-empty prefix and `{}` with an empty name throws — both are `InvalidArgumentException`.
- An unmatched route renders `app/Views/errors/404.php`; a matched route whose Action class does not exist renders
  `app/Views/errors/500.php`.

## Views

`Views\` maps to `app/Views/`. Error views live in `app/Views/errors/`; the framework ships fallbacks but the
application's own copies take precedence. `$router->view()` uses dot notation (`pages.terms` →
`app/Views/pages/terms.php`).

**A view opens with a `@var` docblock naming what its Responder passes it.** The variables arrive by `extract()`,
so nothing in the file declares them, and without the docblock an IDE marks every one as undefined. It is the view's
side of the contract the Responder's array is the other side of, and the generators write both. A partial declares
what the including page may set, as `string|null` where the partial uses `??`:

```php
<?php
/**
 * What Responders\Home\Index hands this view.
 *
 * @var string $appName
 * @var string $tagline
 */
```

It is a promise, not a check: a Responder that stops passing `$tagline` still fails when the page renders.

## Tests

```bash
php tether test                 # or composer test, or vendor/bin/phpunit
php tether test --filter=Home
```

Two suites, and the split is the ADR split:

- **`tests/Unit`** — a Domain or a Result on its own. No Kernel, no routing, no request. A Domain knows nothing about
  HTTP, so testing one needs none of it; that is what the separation buys.
- **`tests/Feature`** — a request through the real Kernel with the real `routes/web.php`, asserting on the `Response`
  it returns. `Tests\TestCase` gives you `get()`, `post()` and `send()`.

The base `TestCase` builds its own `Services` — with an `Env` and a `Log` of its own inside — rather than reading
the `.env` on disk, so a test states the settings it depends on and never writes into `storage/`. That is only
possible because the Kernel is handed them. Override `services()` to hand a feature a fake in place of a real
connection.

It composes **no middleware** by default, so writes are not CSRF-challenged and a feature test stays a single call —
a test that had to mint a token before it could POST would be testing the middleware rather than the feature.
Override `middleware()` to run against the real stack, as `tests/Feature/CsrfTest.php` does:

```php
protected function middleware(): array
{
    return (require __DIR__ . '/../../routes/middleware.php')($this->env(), $this->log());
}
```

A status assertion alone is not enough: the error view is served with a 200 whenever the status was never set, so
assert on the body too. `HomeTest` does.

## Environment

`.env` is required — `Env::fromFile()` throws, naming the path it looked at, if it is missing. Copy it first on a
fresh checkout:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

In a view, read values with `env('KEY')`, or `env('KEY', 'fallback')` for a default. A missing key with no default
returns `null` rather than throwing. `APP_DEBUG=true` turns on error display; anything else suppresses it.

`env()` is a one-line delegate to the `Env` that `public/index.php` built, and so is `logger()` to the `Log`. They
are for templates, which nothing constructs. A Domain is handed its `Env` by the Action — `$services->env` — and
reads it with `$this->env->get('KEY', 'fallback')`, so a unit test can give it one. There is no `Env::getInstance()`:
if you need an environment somewhere the Kernel has not booted — a script of your own — construct one and install
it with `Env::use(Env::fromFile($path))`.

## Assets

Tailwind, configured in `tailwind.config.js` to scan `app/Views/**/*.php`:

```bash
npm install
npx tailwindcss -i ./resources/css/app.css -o ./public/css/app.css --watch
```

New view directories outside `app/Views/` need adding to the `content` globs or their classes get purged.

## Running it

Any PHP server pointed at `public/` works:

```bash
php -S 127.0.0.1:8000 -t public
```

## Where a change belongs

| Change                                                     | Repository        |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Actions, Domains, Responders, views, routes, assets, `.env`  | here              |
| `App\Services` and what `public/index.php` builds into it    | here              |
| Routing, request, session, CSRF, logging, console, stubs     | `tetherphp-core`  |
| The console binary itself (`bin/tether`)                     | `tetherphp-core`  |

If a change needs framework code, it goes to the `tetherphp-core` repository and arrives here as a release — do not
vendor-patch `vendor/dillonsmart/tetherphp-core`, as it is overwritten on the next install.

## Keeping this guide current

These guides are part of the source. When a change makes anything above inaccurate — a new `app/` directory and its
PSR-4 mapping, a routing behaviour change, a new generator, a different asset pipeline — update this file in the same
commit, along with `README.md` if the autoload roots moved.
